              Hi there! I'm a data scientist and PhD candidate in the MS&E department at Stanford University. My interests include polarization, modeling culture, social mobility, trust, and criminal justice. I currently work with <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/">Johan Ugander</a>, <a href="https://5harad.com/">Sharad Goel</a> and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~amirgo/">Amir Goldberg</a>.
              <br/><br/>
              Before coming back to school, I worked at Airbnb on search, experimentation, knowledge sharing, and building out the data science team. I occasionally do part-time data science consulting.
              <br/><br/>

                            We propose the use of choice models to study social network formation. A large number of network formation models (including preferential attachment, triadic closure, node fitness and homophily) can be unified when seen from a discrete choice perspective. The ability to sample data, as well as the existence of theory and software routines, make it easy to fit these models to large graphs.

                            Using public record requests we compiled and analyzed a large dataset of over 130M state patrol stops in 31 U.S. states. We find that minority drivers are persistently more likely to be cited, searched, and arrested than white drivers. We also looked at the impact of marijuana legalization in Washington and Colorado. We released the data, for other researchers to work with.
